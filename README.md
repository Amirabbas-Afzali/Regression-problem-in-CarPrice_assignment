## Overview
Welcome to the readme file for the CarPrice_assignment and Regression project. This project is written in R and focuses on predicting car prices using regression techniques.

## Project Description
The CarPrice_assignment and Regression project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the prices of cars based on various features. The project utilizes regression analysis techniques to build a model that can effectively predict car prices.

## Features
The project includes the following features:
- Data preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis, including handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
- Exploratory data analysis: Various visualizations and statistical techniques are used to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between variables.
- Feature selection: Relevant features are selected based on their impact on the target variable (car prices).
- Model development: Regression models, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests and SVM are implemented to predict car prices.
- Model evaluation: The performance of the models is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error or R-squared.
- Model optimization: Techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are employed to improve the model's performance.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:
- R programming language (version X.X.X)
- RStudio (optional but recommended)
- Required R packages (e.g., dplyr, ggplot2, caret, fastdummy ,...)
